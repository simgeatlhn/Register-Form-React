# Register Form

- A dynamic register form was designed and a special error message was given when the inputs were not suitable for the pattern.
- The onblur attribute fires the moment that the element loses focus. Onblur is most often used with form validation code (e.g. when the user leaves a form field). 
- Tip: The onblur attribute is the opposite of the onfocus attribute.
